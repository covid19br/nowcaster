  trim.data = 0,
  Dmax = 15,
  wdw = 30,
  age_col,
  date_onset,
  date_report,
  data.by.week = FALSE,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Dataset with at least 3 columns, date of onset, date of report and stratum.}

\item{bins_age}{Age bins to do the nowcasting, it receive a vector of age bins,
or options between, "SI-PNI", "10 years", "5 years".
\link{Default} "SI-PNI".}

\item{trim.data}{(in weeks) Date to be trimmed out from the data base, in days.

\link{Default} 0 days.}

\item{Dmax}{(in weeks) Until which maximum amount of weeks the Nowcasting will use for the estimation.
\link{Default} 15 weeks.}

\item{wdw}{(in weeks) Window of dates the estimation will act, i.e., how many past weeks the nowcasting will estimates.
\link{Default} 30 weeks.}

\item{age_col}{Column for ages}

\item{date_onset}{Column of dates of onset of the events, normally date of onset of first symptoms of cases}

\item{date_report}{Column of dates of report of the event, normally date of digitation of the notification of cases}

\item{data.by.week}{If it has to be returned the whole time-series data.
\link{Default} FALSE.}

\item{silent}{\link{Depracted} Should be the warnings turned off?
\link{Default} is TRUE.}

\item{K}{(in weeks) How much weeks to forecast ahead?
\link{Default} K is 0, no forecasting ahead}

\item{trajectories}{Returns the trajectories estimated on the inner 'INLA' model}

\item{zero_inflated}{In non-structured models, fit a model that deals with zero-inflated data.
\link{Default} FALSE. If the \link{age_col} is not missing this flag is ignored.}

\item{...}{}

\item{return.age}{\link{Depracted} If the estimate by Age should be returned.
\link{Default} TRUE.}
}
\value{
a list of 2 elements, each element with a data.frame with nowcasting estimation, 'Total', \n
'data' with the time-series out of wdw .
If 'age_col' is parsed, add a thrid element with by age estimation 'age' .
If 'trajectories' = TRUE, add a forth element with the returned trajectories from 'inla'.
}
\description{
function to estimate amount of events already started by not yet notified.
The main use is to estimate how many cases in a outbreak has already started their onset date of symptons
but has not yet notified.
nowcasting_inla, fits a statistical distribution to the empirical distribution of time of delay between
onset date and report date.
