`nowcaster` is an R package for “nowcasting” epidemiological time-series on individual level data.

Every single system of notification has an intrinsic delay between the `date of onset` of the event and the `date of report`. 
`nowcaster` can estimate how many counts of any epidemiological data of interest
(*i.e.*, daily cases and deaths counts) by fitting a negative binomial
model to the time steps of delay between onset date of the event,
(*i.e.*, date of first symptoms for cases or date of occurrence of
death) and the date of report (*i.e.*, date of notification of the case
or death).

## Installing

After have a proper `INLA` installation to install `nowcaster` package simply run the code below in R:

```{r Installing, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/covid19br/nowcaster")
```
If you have any problem installing, please refer to next section on the dependencies of the package.

## Dependencies

`nowcaster` is based on the
[`R-INLA`](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)
and
[`INLA`](https://inla.r-inla-download.org/r-inla.org/doc/inla-manual/inla-manual.pdf)
packages for “**I**ntegrated **N**ested **L**aplace **A**pproximation”
algorithm to Bayesian inference. `INLA` is a fast alternative to others
methods for Bayesian inference like **MCMC**. An introduction to `INLA`
can be found
[here](https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/inla-gitbook/index.html).

`nowcaster` it was built for epidemiological emergency use, it was
constructed for the Brazilian Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI)
surveillance system (SIVEP-Gripe), at the time of Covid-19 pandemic.

Before installing the package certify you have an active installation of `INLA`, 
to do so you can run the following code:

```{r Installing INLA, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("INLA",
                 repos=c(getOption("repos"),
                         INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), 
                 dep=TRUE)
```

If you want more detail on other possible installations of `INLA`, please refer to the official [page](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install) of the package.

## Similar Initiatives

There are other alternative packages, that can produce nowcasting estimation, here it is some options:
